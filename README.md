To add a post:
1. Create a new folder in /posts
2. Create a file named index.qmd (or whatever supported extension)
3. Commit
4. Run `quarto publish` (optional? I think github actions will do it automatically)


To update the sidebar, edit [_quarto.yml](./_quarto.yml)

To just build: `quarto render`
To preview: `quarto preview`
